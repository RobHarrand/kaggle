#To quote wikipedia ... 

# "The first voyage of James Cook was a combined Royal Navy and Royal Society expedition to the 
# south Pacific Ocean aboard HMS Endeavour, from 1768 to 1771. It was the first of three Pacific 
# voyages of which Cook was the commander. The aims of this first expedition were to observe the 
# 1769 transit of Venus across the Sun (3â€“4 June of that year), and to seek evidence of the 
# postulated Terra Australis Incognita or unknown southern land"

# This script plots the Endeavor's voyage around the world. I've cut the script short and limited 
# it from England to Cape Horn due to the full script taking too long. The full thing can be run 
# by changing the limit of the while loop.  

# The Earth's movement initially followed the ship exactly, but the movement was very jittery. 
# Therefore, the ship's movement is instead fitted with a smoothed spline, and the Earth's movement 
# follows that instead. The ship's movement is as given in the original dataset.  

# I had no idea how to plot a 3D map when I started. The following websites were invaluble,
