Kaggle Kernal - So, You've Run a Diagnostics Test
-------------------------------------------------

1) Opening anecdote ... test results from the GP
2) Back to basics ... what is a diagnostics test?
3) What are the stats of a diagnostic test? - Frequntist (sens, spec, NPV, PPV, ROC, survival analysis)
4) What's wrong with this picture? (focus on sens or spec only, taking the result out of context, different types of biases)
4) The solution? - Enter The Reverand Bayes! (priors, liklihood ratios, elicitation)
5) Evidence based medicine and Critical appraisal
6) Closing with reference to opening anecdote
